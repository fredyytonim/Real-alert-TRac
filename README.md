## 🎯 What It Does

**TRAC Alert System** is a real-time wallet monitoring agent that watches your TRAC/TNK wallet and fires instant alerts when:

- 📥 **Incoming transactions** — Get notified when someone sends you TNK
- 📤 **Outgoing transactions** — Know when tokens leave your wallet
- 🐋 **Whale transactions** — Alert when large single TXs are detected
- 📉 **Balance drops** — Alert when your balance drops by X%

### Example usage:
```
User: "Alert me if I receive more than 100 TNK."
Bot: "✅ Done! I'll alert you whenever you receive more than 100 TNK."
```
